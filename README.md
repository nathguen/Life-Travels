# Personal Project Utilizing AngularFire (AngularJS 1.5 combined with FireBase)

This is a personal project allowing me to explore some ideas I've been having with regards to searching for work. It's built in Angular 1.5 primarily so that I can get a prototype up and running quickly.

The idea for it is to allow someone to explore where they can live, while optimizing their income.

## Future Goals

I would like to integrate this project with job API's to get real-time data expectations for salaries.
